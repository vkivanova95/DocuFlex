# 📄 DocuFlex – Document Automation Platform

**DocuFlex** is an internal Django-based web application designed for automating the full workflow of documents generation, review, signing and archiving. Built for financial institutions, the platform supports modular document processing, role-based user access, audit trails, and integration with external services (e.g., e-signature API).

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🔐 Role-based Access Control (business users, executors/makers, managers, and admin).

* 👤 Client & Contract Management with activation/deactivation and validation rules.

* 🧾 Requests Workflow – creation, assignment, processing.

* 📄 Annex Generator – dynamically generates `.docx` annexes from input data using reusable templates and conditional sections.

* ✅ E-signature integration (mock asynchronous API).

* 🗂️ Annex Archive – filtering, search, pagination, and Excel export.

* 📊 Reports/ Log – track user productivity, document signing history, and system activity.

* 🛠️ Nomenclatures – centralized reference data.

* 💬 News modules – internal communication

## 🧩 Tech Highlights
- **Backend**: Django 5+, PostgreSQL.

- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with custom styles.

- **Asynchronous Views**: `async def` for non-blocking API calls.

- **REST API**: Mock integration for annex signing.

- **File Handling**: Word generation with `python-docx`; Excel export with `openpyxl`.

- **Security**: Custom login, first-login password change, role-based access.

- **Testing**: Unit tests for role access, API endpoints, export functionality.

## 🔗 Model Relationships

Below is a simplified diagram showing the most important relationships between models:


Client  --->  Contract (FK: client)  --->   Request (FK: contract)  --->   GeneratedAnnex (FK: request) --->  SignStatus (signed, failed, pending)


### 🧩 Entity-Relationship Overview

* A Client can have multiple Contracts.

* A Contract can have multiple Requests.

* Each Request is linked to one GeneratedAnnex.

* Each GeneratedAnnex has a signature status and associated file.

* Users with role executor can be assigned to requests.

## ✅ Validations & Business Logic

| Validation / Rule        | Description        |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Unique CompanyEIK	   | Company ID (EIK) must be unique and match Bulgarian format   |
| Request creation        | Only possible if client and contract are active   |
| Cascading deactivation  | If a client is deactivated, all contracts, requests, and annexes are automatically deactivated   |
| One-time signature      | Annexes can be sent for signing only once unless previous attempt failed   |
| Group-based access      | Only users in proper groups (business, executor, manager) can access certain views   |
| Logging   | Every user action (create/edit/assign) is logged with time, user, model, and action   |

## 🛡️ User Roles & Access Control
- **Business User (Бизнес)** – Submit requests and track status.
- **Executor (Изпълнител)** – View and handle assigned requests, generate annexes.
- **Supervisor (Ръководител)** – Assign requests to executors, manage users, view all productivity data.
- **Superuser (admin)** – Full access to all data, users, logs, and configurations.

Access is managed via custom middleware and group-based permissions, enforced both in views and templates.

---

## 📄 Example Workflow
1. **Business User** creates an annex request for a specific contract.

2. **Manager** assigns the request to an **Executor**.

3. **Executor** completes specific fields and generates the annex.

4. All signed annexes go into the **Archive/ Register**, where they are filterable and exportable.

5. Annex is **sent to mock API for signing** – only once if successful.

6. **System Logs** track every action.

7. **Productivity Reports** summarize request/annex volume per executor.

---

## 🔌 REST & Asynchronous API Integration
`POST /api/send-annex/<id>/` – sends the annex to the signature API.

Simulated async result using Celery-style mock view.

Once signed, annex cannot be sent again.

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are located in each app’s `tests/` directory. To run the tests:

```python manage.py test```

The project includes **unit and integration tests**:

- Role-based access testing

- Model validation (e.g. inactive clients)

- API endpoint response

- Export functionality

- View permissions
